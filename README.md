Homework Assignment 20
---


**Task**

1. Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find **two** unexpected phenomena. 

2. Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods.

3. Use the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena.

4. Create a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

5. Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
